The modification made here enhances control over the diffusivity setting in MOM6. By incorporating river forcing and an adjustable depth range condition in the user_change_diffusivity.F90 file, the user can now fine-tune MOM6 diffusivity parameters based on specific depth ranges and runoff values, improving the model's accuracy in simulating oceanic processes affected by external forcing near the river mouth.
